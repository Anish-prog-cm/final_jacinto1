            <p>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cu_Bird">The Cu Bird</a> is an aviary being of vanity. The story goes that the bird was once very upset by its own appearance, so much so that the Owl took pity on him. The Owl convinced other birds to donate a feather each to the Cu in exchange for the Cu becoming a messenger. In the end, the Cu became infatuated with its looks and neglected his role. The Cu and the Owl then became designated as night birds, never to appear in the day.
